Optimal capacitor placement in distribution systems (loss reduction and voltage improvement) using PSO algorithm 

The simulation contains an optimization algorithm (PSO), which is used to find the optimal place and size of the Capacitor in three different power systems. The code is related to the paper shown in the YouTube video. But the algorithm is different than the main paper (we have used PSO). The results are comparable And there are some criteria in the paper that have been neglected for the sake of simplicity.

All the best
